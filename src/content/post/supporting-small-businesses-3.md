## A Journey Long in the Making

My name is Mai, and my journey started long before I became a mother or a small business owner. I came to this country when I was just 10 years old, and I remember watching how hard my mom and siblings worked to make a life for us. 

Their determination and resilience left a lasting impression on me. I always hoped that one day I could make enough to give them a better life—and to ensure that my own children would have more opportunities.

## From Dental Field to Motherhood

Before having kids, my life was focused on working hard in the dental field and enjoying time with my husband. However, after my twins were born, everything changed. 

I fell in love with being a mom and wanted to find a way to balance being present for my kids while still contributing financially to my family. 

## Finding Inspiration During the Pandemic

During the pandemic, I extended my maternity leave for an additional six months, giving me time to reflect on my career and family. That’s when I had a conversation with a hygienist friend who shared her plans to start a teeth whitening business. 

Having worked in the dental field since 2005, I realized I had the skills and knowledge to do something similar. It felt like the perfect opportunity, so I took a leap of faith, and [Simplywhite_gta](https://instagram.com/simplywhite_gta) was born.

## The Present and Future of Simplywhite_gta

Right now, [Simplywhite_gta](https://instagram.com/simplywhite_gta) is still a side business while I continue to work full-time in the dental field. 

But my dream is for it to grow enough to support my family financially and give me the freedom to spend more time with my kids. 

What truly sets [Simplywhite_gta](https://instagram.com/simplywhite_gta) apart is the personal touch I bring to it. 

I enjoy giving my clients advice and sharing preventative care tips to help them take better care of their teeth. I’m passionate about creating a positive experience that goes beyond just whitening—it’s about empowering people to take control of their oral health.
