When my family and I decided to move across the country, I was filled with hope and anticipation. As a colon therapist, I was eager to expand my practice in a larger city, confident that this new chapter would bring prosperity and growth. Little did I know that we were about to face one of the biggest challenges of our lives.

Shortly after we settled into our new home, the world changed. The pandemic struck, and everything came to a standstill. The city went into lockdown, and suddenly, the dreams I had nurtured seemed uncertain. Small businesses like mine felt the brunt of the crisis. A heated debate emerged over what was considered “essential” and what wasn’t. Sadly, my vision of my wellness centre, along with countless others, found itself on the wrong side of that line.

But in the midst of this chaos, I found solace in simplicity. With so much uncertainty swirling around us, I turned to something I could control—creating. I began crafting lip balms and candles, initially just for my loved ones and as a form of therapy for myself. There’s something incredibly grounding about working with your hands, especially when you know exactly what’s going into the products you’re making. Free from artificial additives and full of love, these small creations became a source of comfort.

As I shared these homemade products with friends and family, I realized that I wasn’t alone in valuing the purity and care that went into them. Others shared my desire for clean, trustworthy items, and from this simple act of creation, an idea began to form. Perhaps this could be more than just a personal project—perhaps it could become a business that resonates with people who, like me, are looking for a bit of peace and purity in an unpredictable world.

Thank you for reading about my journey. I’m grateful for the support and encouragement from everyone who has been part of this adventure. Here’s to many more milestones and successes ahead!
