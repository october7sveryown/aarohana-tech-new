Hello, I’m Mansi Varun Deshpande, and I’m excited to share my journey with you all. I am a Gujarati girl (Gujarati is a language spoken in the western part of India). I am from Pune, Maharashtra, India, and now currently settled in Ontario, Canada. I have done my education in Fashion Designing, Gemology & Diamond Grading. Before coming to Canada, I was a long-time entrepreneur back in India for 10 years. I used to run an unstitched dress materials business as a wholesaler. And a 24/7 housewife too, haha!

## The Inspiration

The spark for my entrepreneurial journey came from me itself. But as I said, I belong to a Gujarati family, and we have a business background. After getting married, I was doing nothing, just a good housewife and yes blessed with good in-laws. In 2012, my hubby told me that you should do something, don't waste your talent. At that moment I realized that I need to do something, and I started reselling dress materials through Facebook and WhatsApp. I earned a little bit of money and invested in my dress material business and there was no looking back. In a few years, I established my own business to another level. I was called a successful entrepreneur. I was running my business till 2019 and then suddenly we all, I mean the whole world, were under lockdown due to Covid, so everything was shut down. My hubby was already in the process of moving to Canada. And finally, we came in 2021 to Canada. My biggest supporter and a strong pillar of my life is my husband. He is like a hero to me.

## How it started

After coming here, it took me a year to settle down and we were trying to adapt to things. In June 2023, I again thought of starting some business and literally it took me 6 months to decide what to do and how to do it.

Finally, I came to a decision in Dec 2023, to start a business of Indian Ethnic Imitation Jewelry. As there are not so many options available here.

On 1st Jan 2024, I announced my new venture Moonblushbymansi. It has been an incredible journey. Our strategies included marketing from Instagram. And the journey started again for the new venture, getting clients to complete orders.

### Personal Growth

Starting this business has profoundly impacted me personally. I’ve developed skills such as being more and more creative, and I’ve grown in ways I never imagined. The experience has made me more confident and patient.

### Future goals

Looking ahead, I have big plans for Moonblushbymansi. As everyone says, our dreams should be the biggest, so my dream is to become a manufacturer of jewelry.

### Advice and tips

For those of you considering starting your own business, here are some tips:

- **Believe in your vision**: Stay true to your goals even when the path gets tough.
- **Embrace learning**: Every mistake is an opportunity to learn and grow.
- **Network**: Build relationships with other entrepreneurs and industry experts.
- **Stay customer-focused**: Always prioritize the needs and feedback of your customers.

Thank you for reading about my journey. I’m grateful for the support and encouragement from everyone who has been part of this adventure. Here’s to many more milestones and successes ahead!
